DESCRIPTION
    AltSQL is a way to improve your user experience with "mysql", "sqlite3",
    "psql" and other tool that Perl has DBI drivers for. Currently written
    for MySQL only, the long term goal of this project is to provide users
    of the various SQL-based databases with a familiar command line
    interface but with modern improvements such as color, unicode box
    tables, and tweaks to the user interface that are fast and easy to
    prototype and experiment with.

    There are a few key issues that this programmer has had with using the
    mysql client every day. After looking for alternatives and other ways to
    fix the problems, reimplementing the client in Perl seemed like the
    easiest approach, and lent towards the greatest possible adoption by my
    peers. Here are a few of those issues:

    Ctrl-C kills the program
        All of the shells that we used on a daily basis allow you to abandon
        the half-written statement on the prompt by typing Ctrl-C. Spending
        all day in shells, you expect this behavior to be consistent, but
        you do this in mysql and you will be thrown to the street. Let's do
        what I mean, and abandon the statement.

    Wide output wraps
        We are grateful that mysql at least uses ASCII art for table
        formatting (unlike "sqlite3" for some reason). But there are some
        tables that I work with that have many columns, with long names
        (it's often easier to keep adding columns to a table over time). As
        a result, when you perform a simple `select * from fim limit 4` you
        quickly find your terminal overwhelmed by useless ASCII art
        attempting (and mostly failing) to provide any semblance of meaning
        from the result. You can throw a '\G' onto the command, but if it
        took 10 seconds to execute and you locked tables while doing it, you
        could be slowing down your website or letting your slave fall behind
        on sync.

        Suffice it to say, it's a much better experience if, just like with
        "git diff", wide output is left wide, and you are optionally able to
        scroll horizontally with your arrow keys like you wanted in the
        first place.

    Color
        Most other modern programs we developers use on a daily basis (vim,
        ls, top, git, tmux, screen) offer to provide additional context to
        you via color. By consistently setting colors on a variable type or
        file type, programs can convey to us additional context that allows
        us to better grasp and understand what's happening. They help us be
        smarter and faster at our jobs, and detect when we've made a
        mistake. There's no reason we shouldn't use color to make it obvious
        which column(s) form the primary key of a table, or which columns
        are a number type or string type. The DBI statement handler contains
        lots of context, and we can interrogate the "information_schema"
        tables in mysql for even more.

    Unicode Box characters
        The usage of '|', '+' and '-' for drawing tables and formatting data
        seems a bit antiquated. Other tools are adopting Unicode characters,
        and most programmers are now using terminal programs that support
        Unicode and UTF8 encoding natively. The Unicode box symbol set
        allows seamless box drawing which allows you to read between the
        lines, so to speak. It is less obtrusive, and combining this with
        color you can create a more useful and clear user experience.

    I've thought of a number of other features, but so too have my coworkers
    and friends. Most people I've spoken with have ideas for future
    features. Next time you're using your DB shell and find yourself
    irritated at a feature or bug in the software that you feel could be
    done much better, file a feature request or, better yet, write your own
    plugins.

CONFIGURATION
    The command line arguments inform how to connect to the database,
    whereas the configuration file(s) provide behavior and features of the
    UI.

  Command Line
    The following options are available.

    -h HOSTNAME | --host HOSTNAME
    -u USERNAME | --user USERNAME
    -p | --password=PASSWORD | -pPASSWORD
    --port PORT
    -D DATABASE | --database DATABASE
        Basic connection parameters to the MySQL database.

    --A | --no-auto-rehash
        By default, upon startup and whenever the database is changed, the
        "information_schema" tables will be read to perform tab completion.
        Disable this behavior to get a faster startup time (but no tab
        complete).

  Config File
    We are using Config::Any for finding and parsing the configuration file.
    You may use any format you'd like to write it so long as it's support in
    "Config::Any".

    /etc/altsql.(yml|cnf|ini|js|pl)
    ~/.altsql.(yml|cnf|ini|js|pl)
        Write your configuration file to either the system or the local
        configuration locations. The local file will inherit from the global
        configuration but with local modifications. For purposes of this
        example I'll be writing out the config in YAML, but again any other
        compatible format would do just as well.

      ---
      plugins:
        - Tail

      view_plugins:
        - Color
        - UnicodeBox

      App::AltSQL::View::Plugin::Color:
        header_text:
          default: red
        cell_text:
          is_null: blue
          is_primary_key: bold
          is_number: yellow

      App::AltSQL::View::Plugin::UnicodeBox:
        style: heavy_header
        split_lines: 1
        plain_ascii: 0

    This is the default configuration, and currently encompasses all the
    configurable settings. This should be future safe; as you can see,
    plugins may use this file for their own variables as there are
    namespaced sections.

EXTENDING
    As mentioned above, one key point of this project is to make it easy for
    people to extend. For this reason, I've built it on Moose and offer a
    MooseX::Object::Pluggable interface. If you extend "App::AltSQL", you
    may want to know about the following methods.

  Accessors
    term - the singleton App::AltSQL::Term (or subclass) instance
    view - the class in which all table output will be accomplished
    (defaults to App::AltSQL::View)
    model - where the database calls happen (App::AltSQL::Model::MySQL)
    args
        Hash of the command line arguments

    config
        Hash of the file configuration

  parse_cli_args \@ARGV
    Called in "bin/altsql" to collect command line arguments and return a
    hashref

  resolve_namespace_config_value $namespace, $key | [ $key1, $key2, ... ], \%default_config
      $self->resolve_namespace_config_value('MyApp', 'timeout', { timeout => 60 });
      # Will search $self->config->{MyApp}{timeout} and will return that or the default 60 if not present

    Provides plugin authors with easy access to the configuration file.
    Provide either an arrayref of keys for deep hash matching or a single
    key for a two dimensional hash.

  get_namespace_config_value $namespace, $key
    Return a config value of the given key in the namespace. Returns empty
    list if non-existant.

  read_config_file
    Will read in all the config file(s) and return the config they represent

  new_from_cli
    Called in "altsql" to read in the command line arguments and create a
    new instance from them and any config files found.

  run
    Start the shell up and enter the readline event loop.

  shutdown
    Perform any cleanup steps here.

  handle_term_input $input
    The user has just typed something and submitted the buffer. Do something
    with it. Most notably, parse it for directives and act upon them.

  call_command $command, $input
    Currently, the application treats any text that starts with a period as
    a command to the program rather then as SQL to be sent to the server.
    This method will be called with that command and the full line types.
    So, if someone typed '.reset screen', command would be 'reset' and the
    input woudl be '.reset screen'. This is naturally a good place to add
    any extensions to the SQL syntax.

  create_view %args
    Call App::AltSQL::View "new()", mixing in the app and command line view
    arguments and loading any requested plugins.

  log_info, log_debug, log_error
    Your basic logging methods, they all currently do the same thing.
